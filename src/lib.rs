//! Edict is a fast, powerful and ergonomic ECS crate that expands traditional ECS feature set.
//! Written in Rust by your fellow ü¶Ä
//!
//! # Basic usage üå±
//!
//! ```
//! use edict::prelude::*;
//!
//! // Create world instance.
//! let mut world = World::new();
//!
//! // Declare some components.
//! #[derive(Component)]
//! struct Pos(f32, f32);
//!
//! // Declare some more.
//! #[derive(Component)]
//! struct Vel(f32, f32);
//!
//! // Spawn entity with components.
//! world.spawn((Pos(0.0, 0.0), Vel(1.0, 1.0)));
//!
//! // Query components and iterate over views.
//! for (pos, vel) in world.view::<(&mut Pos, &Vel)>() {
//!   pos.0 += vel.0;
//!   pos.1 += vel.1;
//! }
//!
//!
//! // Define functions that will be used as systems.
//! #[edict::system::system] // This attribute is optional, but it catches if function is not a system.
//! fn move_system(pos_vel: View<(&mut Pos, &Vel)>) {
//!   for (pos, vel) in pos_vel {
//!     pos.0 += vel.0;
//!     pos.1 += vel.1;
//!   }
//! }
//!
//! # #[cfg(feature = "scheduler")]
//! # {
//! // Create scheduler to run systems. Requires "scheduler" feature.
//! use edict::scheduler::Scheduler;
//!
//! let mut scheduler = Scheduler::new();
//! scheduler.add_system(move_system);
//!
//! // Run systems without parallelism.
//! scheduler.run_sequential(&mut world);
//!
//! # #[cfg(feature = "std")]
//! # {
//! // Run systems using threads. Requires "std" feature.

//! # }
//!
//! // Or use custom thread pool.
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! ## Entities üß©
//!
//! ### Simple IDs
//!
//! In *Entity* Component Systems we create entities and address them to fetch associated data.
//! Edict provides [`EntityId`] type to address entities.
//!
//! [`EntityId`] as a world-unique identifier of an entity.
//! Edict uses IDs without generation and recycling, for this purpose it employs `u64` underlying type with a niche.
//! It is enough to create IDs non-stop for hundreds of years before running out of them.
//!
//! [`EntityId`] can be converted into bits and from bits.
//!
//! This greatly simplifying serialization of the [`World`]'s state as it doesn't require any processing of entity IDs.
//!
//! By default entity IDs are unique only within one [`World`].
//! For multi-world scenarios Edict provides a way to make entity IDs unique between any required combination of worlds.
//!
//! IDs are allocated in sequence from [`IdRange`]s that are allocated by [`IdRangeAllocator`].
//! By default [`IdRange`] that spans from 1 to `u64::MAX - 1` is used. This makes default ID allocation extremely fast.
//! Custom [`IdRangeAllocator`] can be provided to [`WorldBuilder`] to use custom ID ranges.
//!
//! For example in client-server architecture, server and client may use non-overlapping ID ranges.
//! Thus allowing state serialized on server to be transferred to client without ID mapping,
//! which can be cumbersome when components reference entities.
//!
//! In multi-server or p2p architecture [`IdRangeAllocator`] would need to communicate to allocate disjoint ID ranges for each server.
//!
//! ### Ergonomic entity types
//!
//! Using ECS may lead to lots of `.unwrap()` calls or excessive error handling.
//! There a lot of situations when entity is guaranteed to exist (for example it just returned from a view).
//! To avoid handling [`NoSuchEntity`] error when it is unreachable, Edict provides [`AliveEntity`] trait that extends [`Entity`] trait.
//! Various methods require [`AliveEntity`] handle and skip existence check.
//!
//! [`Entity`] and [`AliveEntity`] traits implemented for number of entity types.
//!
//! [`EntityId`] implements only [`Entity`] as it doesn't provide any guaranties.
//!
//! [`EntityBound`] is guaranteed to be alive, allowing using it in methods that doesn't handle entity absence.
//! It keeps lifetime of [`World`] borrow, making it impossible to despawn any entity from the world.
//! Using it with wrong [`World`] may cause panic.
//! [`EntityBound`] can be acquire from relation queries.
//!
//! [`EntityLoc`] not only guarantees entity existence but also contains location of the entity in the archetypes,
//! allowing to skip lookup step when accessing its components.
//! Similarly to [`EntityBound`], it keeps lifetime of [`World`] borrow, making it impossible to despawn any entity from the world.
//! Using it with wrong [`World`] may cause panic.
//! [`EntityLoc`] can be acquire from [`Entities`] query.
//!
//! [`EntityRef`] is special.
//! It doesn't implement [`Entity`] or [`AliveEntity`] traits since it should not be used in world methods.
//! Instead it provides direct access to entity's data and allows mutations such as inserting/removing components.
//!
//! ## Components üõ†Ô∏è
//!
//! ### Non-thread-safe types
//!
//! Support for [`!Send`] and [`!Sync`] components and resources with some limitations.
//!
//! [`World`] itself is not sendable but shareable between threads.
//! Thread owning [`World`] is referred as "main" thread in documentation.
//!
//! Components and resources that are [`!Send`] can be fetched mutably only from "main" thread.
//! Components and resources that are [`!Sync`] can be fetched immutably only from "main" thread.
//! Since reference to [`World`] may exist outside "main" thread, [`WorldLocal`] reference should be used,
//! it can be created using mutable reference to [`World`].
//!
//! ### Components with trait and without
//!
//! Optional [`Component`] trait that allows implicit component type registration when component is inserted first time.
//! Implicit registration uses behavior defined by [`Component`] implementation as-is.
//! When needed, explicit registration can be done using [`WorldBuilder`] to override component behavior.
//!
//! Non [`Component`] types require explicit registration and
//! few methods with `_external` suffix is used with them instead of normal ones.
//! Only default registration is possible when [`World`] is already built.
//! When needed, explicit registration can be done using [`WorldBuilder`] to override component behavior.
//!
//! ## Entity relations üîó
//!
//! A relation can be added to pair of entities, binding them together.
//! Queries may fetch relations and filter entities by their relations to other entities.
//! When either of the two entities is despawned, relation is dropped.
//! [`Relation`] type may further configure behavior of the bounded entities.
//!
//! ## Queries üîç
//!
//! Powerful [`Query`] mechanism that can filter entities by components, relations and other criteria and fetch entity data.
//! Queries can be mutable or immutable, sendable or non-sendable, stateful or stateless.
//!
//! Using query on [`World`] creates Views.
//! Views can be used to iterate over entities that match the query yielding query items.
//! Or fetch single entity data.
//!
//! [`ViewRef`] and [`ViewMut`] are convenient type aliases to view types returned from [`World`] methods.
//!
//! ## Runtime and compile time checks
//!
//! Runtime checks are available for query mutable aliasing avoidance.
//!
//! [`ViewRef`] and [`ViewCell`] do runtime checks allowing multiple views with aliased access coexist,
//! deferring checks to runtime that prevents invalid aliasing to occur.
//!
//! When this is not required, [`ViewMut`] and [`View`]s with compile time checks should be used instead.
//!
//! When [`View`] is expected [`ViewRef`] and [`ViewCell`] can be locked to make a [`View`].
//!
//! ### Borrows
//!
//! Component type may define borrowing operations to borrow another type from it.
//! Borrowed type may be not sized, allowing slices and dyn traits to be borrowed.
//! A macro to help define borrowing operations is provided.
//! Queries that tries to borrow type from suitable components are provided:
//! * [`BorrowAll`] borrows from all components that implement borrowing requested type.
//!   Yields a `Vec` with borrowed values since multiple components of the entity may provide it.
//!   Skips entities if none of the components provide the requested type.
//! * [`BorrowAny`] borrows from first suitable component that implements borrowing requested type.
//!   Yields a single value.
//!   Skips entities if none of the components provide the requested type.
//! * [`BorrowOne`] is configured with [`TypeId`] of component from which it should borrow requested type.
//!   Panics if component doesn't provide the requested type.
//!   Skips entities without the component.
//!
//! ## Resources üì¶
//!
//! Built-in type-map for singleton values called "resources".
//! Resources can be inserted into/fetched from [`World`].
//! Resources live separately from entities and their components.
//!
//! ## Actions üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
//!
//! Use [`ActionEncoder`] for recording actions and run them later with mutable access to [`World`].
//! Or [`LocalActionEncoder`] instead when action is not [`Send`].
//! Or convenient [`WorldLocal::defer*`] methods to defer actions to internal [`LocalActionEncoder`].
//!
//! ## Automatic change tracking ü§ñ
//!
//! Each component instance is equipped with epoch counter that tracks last potential mutation of the component.
//! Queries may read and update components epoch to track changes.
//! Queries to filter recently changed components are provided with [`Modified`] type.
//! Last epoch can be obtained with [`World::epoch`].
//!
//! ## Systems ‚öôÔ∏è
//!
//! Systems is convenient way to build logic that operates on [`World`].
//! Edict defines [`System`] trait to run logic on [`World`].
//! And [`IntoSystem`] trait for types convertible to [`System`].
//!
//! Functions may implement [`IntoSystem`] automatically -
//! it is required to return `()` and accept arguments that implement [`FnArg`] trait.
//! There are [`FnArg`] implementations:
//!
//! - [`View`] and [`ViewCell`] to iterate over entities and their components.
//!   Use [`View`] unless [`ViewCell`] is required to handle intra-system views conflict.
//! - [`Res`] and [`ResMut`] to access resources.
//! - [`ResLocal`] and [`ResMutLocal`] to access no-thread-safe resources.
//!   This will make system non-sendable and force it to run on main thread.
//! - [`ActionEncoder`] to record actions that mutate [`World`] state, such as entity spawning, inserting and removing components or resources.
//! - [`State`] to store system's local state between runs.
//!
//! ## Easy scheduler üìÖ
//!
//! [`Scheduler`] is provided to run [`System`]s.
//! Systems added to the [`Scheduler`] run in parallel where possible,
//! however they act **as if** executed sequentially in order they were added.
//!
//! If systems do not conflict they may be executed in parallel.
//!
//! If systems conflict, the one added first will be executed before the one added later can start.
//!
//! `std` threads or `rayon` can be used as an executor.
//! User may provide custom executor by implementing [`ScopedExecutor`] trait.
//!
//! Requires `"scheduler"` feature which is enabled by default.
//!
//! ## Hooks üé£
//!
//! Component replace/drop hooks are called automatically when component is replaced or dropped.
//!
//! When component is registered it can be equipped with hooks to be called when component value is replaced or dropped.
//! Implicit registration of [`Component`] types will register hooks defined on the trait impl.
//!
//! Drop hook is called when component is dropped via [`World::drop`] or entity is despawned and is not
//! called when component is removed from entity.
//!
//! Replace hook is called when component is replaced e.g. component is inserted into entity
//! and entity already has component of the same type.
//! Replace hook returns boolean value that indicates if drop hook should be called for replaced component.
//!
//! Hooks can record actions into provided [`LocalActionEncoder`] that will be executed
//! before [`World`] method that caused the hook to be called returns.
//!
//! When component implements [`Component`] trait, hooks defined on the trait impl are registered automatically to call
//! [`Component::on_drop`] and [`Component::on_replace`] methods.
//! They may be overridden with custom hooks using [`WorldBuilder`].
//! For non [`Component`] types hooks can be registered only via [`WorldBuilder`].
//! Default registration with [`World`] will not register any hooks.
//!
//! ## Async-await ‚è≥
//!
//! Futures executor to run logic that requires waiting for certain conditions or events
//! or otherwise spans for multiple ticks.
//!
//! Logic that requires waiting can be complex to implement using systems.
//! Systems run in loop and usually work on every entity with certain components.
//! Implementing waiting logic would require adding waiting state to existing or new components and
//! logic would be spread across many system runs or even many systems.
//!
//! Futures may use `await` syntax to wait for certain conditions or events.
//! Futures that can access ECS data are referred in Edict as "flows".
//!
//! Flows can be spawned in the [`World`] using [`World::spawn_flow`] or [`FlowWorld::spawn_flow`] method.
//! [`Flows`] type is used as an executor to run spawned flows.
//!
//! Flows can be bound to an entity and spawned using [`World::spawn_flow_for`], [`FlowWorld::spawn_flow_for`], [`EntityRef::spawn_flow`] or [`FlowEntity::spawn_flow`] method.
//! Such flows will be cancelled if entity is despawned.
//!
//! Functions that return futures may serve as flows.
//! For [`World::spawn_flow`] use function or closure with signature `FnOnce(FlowWorld) -> Future`
//! For [`World::spawn_flow_for`] use function or closure with signature `FnOnce(FlowEntity) -> Future`
//!
//! User may implement low-level futures using `poll*` methods of [`FlowWorld`] and [`FlowEntity`] to access tasks [`Context`].
//! Edict provides only a couple of low-level futures that will do the waiting:
//! - [`yield_now!`] yields control to the executor once and resumes on next execution.
//! - [`FlowEntity::wait_despawned`] waits until entity is despawned.
//! - [`FlowEntity::wait_has_component`] waits until entity get a component.
//!
//! [`WakeOnDrop`] component can be used when despawning entity should wake a task.
//!
//! It is recommended to use flows for high-level logic that spans multiple ticks
//! and use systems to do low-level logic that runs every tick.
//! Flows may request systems to perform operations by adding special components to entities.
//! And systems may spawn flows to do long-running operations.
//!
//! Requires `"flow"` feature which is enabled by default.
//!
//! # no_std support
//!
//! Edict can be used in `no_std` environment but requires `alloc` crate.
//! `"std"` feature is enabled by default.
//!
//! If "std" feature is not enabled error types will not implement [`std::error::Error`].
//!
//! When "flow" feature is enabled and "std" is not, extern functions are used to implement TLS.
//! Application must provide implementation for these functions or linking will fail.
//!
//! "scheduler" feature enables [`Scheduler`] type.
//! "threaded-scheduler" feature enables multithreaded execution for [`Scheduler`], using [`Scheduler::run_with`] and [`Scheduler::run_threaded`].
//! "rayon-scheduler" feature enables rayon based execution for [`Scheduler`] using [`Scheduler::run_rayon`].
